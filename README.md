# Is Kratom Legal in California? Here's What You Need to Know (2026)
Kratom has a huge following in California, and for good reason. Millions of people across the country use it for [euphoria](https://github.com/best-kratom/best-kratom-for-euphoria) energy, relaxation, mood support, and general well-being. But if you live in California, you have probably run into some confusing information about whether you can actually buy it.

The legal picture in California is a bit messy right now. This guide gives you the full picture in plain language so you know exactly where things stand, where you can and cannot buy kratom, and what changes might be coming soon.

## Key Takeaways
- **Kratom is not banned in California**. No state law makes it a controlled substance or prohibits personal use.
- The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) considers kratom products unapproved under existing food safety codes, which has affected retail availability in many areas.
- Some cities like **San Diego** and **Oceanside** have their own local restrictions. Other areas like Fresno County allow regulated sales.
- A bill called AB 1088 passed the California Assembly unanimously in 2025 and would create a formal regulatory framework for kratom if the Senate passes it. This would be a major positive step toward clear, regulated access.
- Personal possession of kratom is completely fine under California law. The regulatory focus is on the retail and manufacturing side.

## Is Kratom Legal in California?
### Personal Use and Possession
Yes, you can have kratom in California. There is no statute that restricts personal possession. CDPH has publicly stated that they do not have authority over individuals who have kratom products. So if you already use kratom, nothing about your personal use has changed.
### Buying Kratom in California
This is where it gets a little tricky. CDPH's position is that kratom has not been approved by the FDA as a food additive, dietary supplement, or drug. Because California's food safety codes adopt federal standards through the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, CDPH considers retail sale of kratom products for human consumption to be noncompliant with those codes.

In practical terms, this means some retail stores have been asked to remove kratom products from their shelves. Availability varies depending on where you are in the state. Some areas still have kratom on shelves, while others have seen products pulled during routine inspections.
### The Important Context
This is not a new law. The California Legislature has not passed a ban on kratom. What is happening is that a state health agency is applying existing food safety regulations to kratom because the FDA has not given it formal approval. Many in the kratom community, including the American Kratom Association, see this as an overreach and are actively pushing for proper regulation instead.

## Where Can You Buy Kratom in California?

### City and County Breakdown
Kratom availability in California depends a lot on your specific location. Here is a quick look at how different parts of the state are handling things right now.
| Location| Status | Details 
|------------|----------|-----------|
| San Diego | Banned | Local ban on kratom sales predating CDPH action|
| Oceanside | Banned | Local ordinance banning kratom and synthetic derivatives|
| Newport Beach | Banned | Local ban on kratom products|
| Fresno County | Regulated | Sales allowed with 21+ age check, 7-OH limits, ID verification, no child-appealing packaging|
| Los Angeles County | Enforcement Active | CDPH enforcement ongoing; 6 overdose deaths linked to 7-OH products reported in 2025 |
| Sonoma County | Enforcement Active | Products being embargoed and removed from retailers; no formal local ban yet|
| Statewide (All Other Areas) | Sales Treated as Unlawful | CDPH considers all retail kratom sales for consumption unlawful under HSC 110555|

This picture changes frequently. Always check with shops in your area for the most current availability. And keep in mind that Fresno County's approach, allowing regulated sales with age checks and quality standards, is a good model for what statewide regulation could eventually look like.

### Buying Kratom Online
Many California residents [buy kratom from online vendors](https://github.com/best-kratom/buy-kratom) based in other states. Since California's regulatory focus is on retailers and manufacturers within the state, online purchasing from out-of-state vendors remains an option that many people use. If you go this route, stick with reputable vendors that provide third-party lab testing, clear ingredient labels, and AKA GMP certification.

## Natural Kratom Leaf vs Concentrated 7-OH Products
### Why This Distinction Matters
One of the biggest frustrations in California's approach is that it treats traditional kratom leaf powder and concentrated 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH) products the same way. These are very different things.

Natural kratom leaf contains mitragynine as its main alkaloid, with only trace amounts of 7-OH, usually less than 2 percent. It has been used in Southeast Asia for centuries as a tea and mild botanical. If you want to understand the full range of [types of kratom](https://github.com/best-kratom/types-of-kratom) and how they differ by strain, color, and effect, our complete guide breaks that down.

### What Are 7-OH Products?
Concentrated 7-OH products are manufactured to amplify the most potent compound in kratom. These products can be dramatically stronger than traditional leaf, which is why they have drawn the most concern from health agencies. The FDA itself has actually drawn a line here at the federal level, stating that its enforcement focus is on concentrated 7-OH products and that it is not targeting natural kratom leaf.

Unfortunately, California's CDPH has not adopted that same distinction, which is why the current situation feels heavy-handed to many kratom consumers who use simple leaf powder or tea. Therefore, it is advisable to purchase [kratom products](https://github.com/best-kratom/best-kratom-products) from vendors such as [Happy Go Leafy](behappygoleafy.com), which offer products that do not contain 7-OH.

## AB 1088: Regulation Could Be Coming Soon
### What the Bill Would Do
Assembly Bill 1088 is genuinely good news for the kratom community in California. Rather than pushing toward a ban, this bill would create a clear legal framework for regulated kratom sales. Think of it as California's version of the Kratom Consumer Protection Acts that states like Arizona, Utah, and Georgia already have in place.

Here is what AB 1088 includes:
- Minimum purchase age of 21 for all kratom products
- Child-resistant packaging required for the life of the product.
- No marketing or packaging designed to appeal to children, including cartoon imagery and candy-like branding.
- A cap on 7-OH concentration at no more than 2 percent of total kratom alkaloids.
- Age-verification systems required for online retailers.

### Where the Bill Stands Right Now
AB 1088 passed the California Assembly unanimously, 76 to 0, in June 2025. It was referred to the Senate Health Committee, which held an informational hearing on kratom on February 18, 2026. The bill is still pending a Senate committee vote as of this writing. You can follow its progress directly on the California Legislature website.

If this passes, it would replace the current ambiguous situation with a clear, regulated market. Kratom would be legally sold under defined safety standards, which is a much better outcome than the gray area California is sitting in right now.

## How Federal Law Fits Into the Picture
### Kratom at the Federal Level
Kratom is not a federally scheduled substance. The DEA considered scheduling it back in 2016 but backed off after significant public response. The FDA has not approved kratom for any medical use, but there is no federal ban on it either.
### Why the FDA's Position Matters for California
California's food safety codes mirror federal standards. Because the FDA has not approved kratom as a food, supplement, or drug, CDPH treats it as unapproved under state codes. That is the entire basis for the current retail restrictions. If the FDA's position on kratom were to change, or if California passes its own regulatory framework through AB 1088, the retail landscape would shift significantly.
### How Other States Handle It
Most states allow kratom sales. Several have passed Kratom Consumer Protection Acts (KCPAs) that set age limits, testing requirements, labeling standards, and potency caps. Arizona, Utah, Georgia, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, and Colorado all have KCPA frameworks. Seven states have full restrictions: Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. California sits in an unusual middle ground where there is no formal ban but retail enforcement is active. 

## Practical Tips for Kratom Users in California
### Prioritize Quality and Safety
No matter where you buy kratom, product quality is the most important factor. Only purchase from vendors that provide batch-specific Certificates of Analysis (COAs) from independent labs. These should test for alkaloid content, heavy metals, pesticides, and microbial contamination. AKA GMP-certified vendors have undergone manufacturing audits for additional assurance. 
### Understand What You Are Buying
Stick with natural kratom leaf products rather than concentrated 7-OH formulations. [Kratom powder](https://github.com/best-kratom/best-kratom-powder), crushed leaf, [extracts](https://github.com/best-kratom/best-kratom-extract) capsules, and [kratom gummies guide](https://github.com/best-kratom/best-kratom-gummies) from [reputable brands](https://github.com/best-kratom/Best-Kratom-Brands) all use standard alkaloid concentrations. Avoid products with vague labels, proprietary blends, or no published lab results.
### Stay Informed
The situation in California is changing. AB 1088 could create a regulated market. CDPH's approach could evolve. Local ordinances get updated. The best thing you can do is keep an eye on developments. Follow the American Kratom Association for advocacy updates, and check your city or county's official resources for local rules.
## A Quick Note on Health and Safety
Kratom interacts with opioid receptors, and like any active botanical, it deserves respect. At lower doses it tends to be energizing, while higher doses lean toward relaxation and sedation. Regular daily use can build tolerance, so most experienced users recommend taking breaks and rotating between different strains.

The FDA has not approved kratom for any medical use, and concentrated 7-OH products carry higher risk due to their potency. If you are new to kratom, start with a low dose of a mild strain and see how your body responds. Our [types of kratom guide](https://github.com/best-kratom/types-of-kratom) can help you figure out which strain and color might be the best starting point for your needs.
Always talk to your doctor before trying kratom if you take prescription medications or have existing health conditions.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Can I use kratom in California without any legal issues?
Yes. Personal possession and use of kratom is not prohibited under any California statute. The regulatory focus is entirely on the retail and manufacturing side, not on individual consumers.

### Why are some stores pulling kratom off shelves?
CDPH has been reaching out to retailers and informing them that kratom products do not comply with California's food safety codes because the FDA has not approved kratom as a food, supplement, or drug. Some stores have voluntarily removed products, while others have had products removed during inspections.

### Can I order kratom online and have it delivered to California?
Many people in California do purchase kratom from out-of-state online vendors. The regulatory focus in California is on in-state retail sales, not on consumers receiving shipments. That said, always buy from vendors with verified lab testing and clear quality standards.

### Is there a difference between how California treats natural kratom and 7-OH?
Currently, CDPH treats both the same under its food safety interpretation. This is different from the federal FDA position, which specifically targets concentrated 7-OH while stating it is not focused on natural kratom leaf products. AB 1088, if passed, would formally distinguish between the two by capping 7-OH at 2 percent of total alkaloids.

### Will kratom become fully regulated and legally sold in California?
That is exactly what AB 1088 aims to do. The bill passed the Assembly unanimously and is pending in the Senate. If enacted, it would create a regulated market with age restrictions, packaging standards, and potency limits, similar to what states like Arizona and Utah already have.

### How does California compare to other states on kratom?
California is more restrictive than most states right now, but it is not among the seven states that have full statutory restrictions on kratom. Most of the U.S. allows kratom sales with little or no specific regulation. California's situation is unique because the restrictions come from administrative enforcement rather than a passed law, which is why AB 1088 matters so much.

### What should I look for when buying kratom?
Third-party lab reports (COAs), clear ingredient labels, AKA GMP certification on the vendor, and natural alkaloid concentrations rather than concentrated 7-OH formulations. 

## Final Thoughts
The bottom line is pretty simple. You can use kratom in California. Nobody is coming after individual consumers. The complications are on the retail side, where CDPH's interpretation of food safety codes has reduced in-store availability in many areas.

The good news is that AB 1088 is moving through the legislature and would create a clear, regulated pathway for legal kratom sales statewide. That would replace the current gray area with real rules that protect consumers while keeping kratom accessible.

In the meantime, online purchasing from reputable vendors remains an option, Fresno County shows what local regulation can look like, and the kratom community in California is more active than ever in pushing for fair, sensible regulation. Stay informed, buy smart, and take care of yourself.
